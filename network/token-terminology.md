# Token Terminology

**CC** is the native token of Cascadia. It stands as the principal medium of exchange and the essential element of our blockchain structure.

**tCC** is our test token, utilized to ensure Cascadia's robustness and reliability through various testing processes prior to mainnet operations.

**aCC** is the smallest denomination of Cascadia's native token.&#x20;

Unlike the _u_ (micro) denotation common in other Cosmos chains, Cascadia utilizes _a_ to signify micro-level transactions, promoting increased precision and system adaptability.

**What it is:** In Cascadia, 'atto-' _(a)_ represents the smallest unit of the native token, CC. This denomination is denoted as aCC.

**The Mathematical Point:** 'Atto-' is a unit prefix in the metric system. It denotes a factor of 10^-18, or one quintillionth. This means that 1 CC can be divided into 1 quintillion (1,000,000,000,000,000,000) aCC.

**Why it matters:** The use of 'atto-' allows for a high degree of precision in transactions involving CC. This precision ensures the ability to perform micro-transactions, which are transactions involving minuscule amounts.
