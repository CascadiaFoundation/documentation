Cascadia is a hybrid, layer-1 blockchain built to explore the nature of incentives on network effects, starting with ve-tokenomics.  Our mission is to create a chain that a) people actually use and b) economically makes sense. As trailblazers of the neo-cybernetic movement, we're committed to developing innovative solutions to web3's problems via social and artificial intelligence.

Cascadia is an EVM-compatible network optimized for fairness, speed, and security. We've adopted the Tendermint DPoS consensus due to its flexibility and ease of customization and embraced the IBC protocol, enabling seamless data exchange across sovereign networks.  Cascadia seeks to create a unique value proposition by diving deeper than the consensus layer, to explore emergent behaviors and incentive alignment within complex adaptive systems.

Cascadia's anticipated success can be attributed to the unwavering commitment of over 500 global contributors.  We're immensely proud of our talented and diverse community and are confident that together, we'll redefine what's possible with blockchain technology.
